Celebrate progress: Acknowledge and celebrate your achievements along the way, no matter how small they may seem. Recognizing your efforts can help boost your motivation and self-esteem.\n\n3. Seek support: Talk to a trusted colleague, mentor, or supervisor about your feelings of self-doubt. They can offer guidance, reassurance, and perspective that might help alleviate your concerns.\n\n4. Practice self-care: Take care of your physical and mental well-being. Make sure you get enough rest, eat nutritious meals, engage in activities you enjoy, and take breaks when needed. A healthy mind and body can positively impact your motivation.\n\n5. Challenge negative thoughts: Recognize any negative thoughts or self-critical beliefs that may be contributing to your demotivation. Replace them with more positive and realistic perspectives. Remember that setbacks and challenges are opportunities for growth and learning.\n\n6. Focus on your strengths: Reflect on your past successes and the skills you bring to your department. Recognizing your strengths can boost your confidence and help you see your value and contributions.\n\nRemember, it's okay to ask for help and take breaks when needed.
